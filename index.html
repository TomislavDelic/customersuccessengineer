                        <p>I like to help people when they have a problem. At my current job as a personal assistant,I daily assist people to resolve their problems, 
                            whether they are technical in nature or not.</p>

                        <p>I want to work for your company because I think I can learn a lot and acquire new skills that would make me a valuable part of the team.</p>

                        <h3>Tell us about a platform you believe has solved a complex problem really well, and why. Would you change anything in their approach?</h3>
                        <p> Pluralsight and Udemy! For the past almost two years I have been using both platforms regularly and I think they are one of the better ones when it comes to online 
                            learning. Both platforms offer a wide variety of content for online learning. In recent months I have used both platforms to get acquainted with databases 
                            specifically Oracle (PL/SQL).
                            In my opinion, why I would single out Pluralsight and Udemy from other learning platforms is the quality of the courses. Both platforms have very well 
                            conceptualized courses. Courses can be selected based on the required level of knowledge as well as based on grades of previous users who attended the course.
                            I wish that on the Pluralsight platform users are more encouraged to give their opinion about the quality of the courses through the rating system.
